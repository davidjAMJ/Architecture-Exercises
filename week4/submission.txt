the difference between lexic and semantic is that lexical matching is when the AI system match based them
on their appearance so for example sentence 0 has the word bank so then the other sentence with bank on it got flagged
semantic analysis is more about trying to match words based on context so if a sentence talked about food but
did not talk about the food that was specified in the other sentence and they match then that is
semantic matching because they are related but dont exactly match in sentence 9 the first choice was about a woman 
and in the ninth sentsence talked about painting a woman

for the most part retrievals are accurate on matching sentences some results will seem abvious
as to why they are connected but then for still a larger portion of the time you can see that
there is a very loose connection as to why its one of the top 3 matches
it also does not help to see why it makes such a connection but by understanding what its 
trying to match you can get a jist as to what it is trying to do
